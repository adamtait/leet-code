 *
 * My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait
 * staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.
 *
 * I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for
 * the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get
 * combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be
 * handled first-come, first-served.
 *
 * Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who
 * placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's
 * not good for business!
 *
 * To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the
 * registers with my laptop and recorded: 
 *
 * 1. The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and
 * given to the kitchen. (takeOutOrders)
 *
 * 2. The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and
 * given to the kitchen. (dineInOrders)
 *
 * 3. Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by
 * the kitchen. (servedOrders)
 *
 * Given all three arrays, write a function to check that my service
 * is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same
 * order customers requested it.
 *
 * We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

/** Thoughts
 + should be able to iterate through servedOrders in O(n) time
 + edge cases?
   + missing orders
     + assume illegal
   + servedOrders value not in either [takeOutOrders, dineInOrders]
     + in real life, should probably be skipped
     + assume illegal

 solution 1:
 + keep an index [j,k] to each of [takeOutOrders, dineInOrders]
 + if servedOrders[i] not takeOutOrders[j] || dineInOrders[k]
   + => invalid order
 + space: O(1)

 solution 2:
 + time: O(2*n)
 + iterate through each servedOrders 
   + checking order of [takeOutOrders, dineInOrders]
   + do each one at a time
 + code would be slightly less complex
   + only need to make a single array & iterator/index at a time
